I'm interested in AI and decentralization as a way to build a safe, transparent, free, and bright world.

Currently building a decentralizaed open-source ecosystem of tools to help developers make anything and everything decentralized.

If people go on vacation to have fun, I write code.

If people drink when depressed. I write code.

If people get rest after a hard day. I write code.

Coding is everything for me.

Contact me on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@multineon:gitter.im) and let's code something.
