I'm interested in AI and decentralization as a way to build a safe, transparent, free, and bright world.

Currently building a decentralizaed open-source ecosystem of tools to help developers make anything and everything decentralized.

I believe that decentralizedation is not just about crypto, but decentralized real-time databases, peer-to-peer communications, decentralized and secure data scopes and AI-powered policies.

Contact me on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@multineon:gitter.im) and let's decentralize the world together.
