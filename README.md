### Kais Radwan

Self-taught developer interested in AI and decentralization as a way to build a safe, transparent, and free world for everyone.

The good part:
- Coding since I was 12 just because I love it.
- Founder of Multi Neon, Koxy AI, and ddeep-eco.
- Use Neovim because it's the best.
- Hates social media.

The bad part:
- Stuck in Typescript trying to move to Rust.
- Have skill issues. (Confirmed by a developer on Twitter who uses VsCode but forgot his name)

The code I write is everything I've ever had and will have.

Contact me on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@multineon:gitter.im) and let's code something together.
